User: Hi, I'm looking for a public school in Boston for my child who will be starting kindergarten next year.

Bot: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find the right public school in Boston. To better assist you, could you tell me:
1. Which neighborhood do you live in?
2. Do you have any specific preferences (like language programs, special education services, or after-school programs)?
3. Would you prefer a traditional public school or a charter school?

User: We live in Jamaica Plain, and I'm interested in schools with strong language programs. My child is already showing interest in learning Spanish.

Bot: Great! I can help you with that. There are several excellent options in Jamaica Plain and nearby areas. Let me suggest a few schools that might be a good fit:

1. The Hernandez K-8 School in Roxbury (about 1.5 miles from JP) offers a Spanish-English dual language program starting from kindergarten. They have a strong academic reputation and diverse student body.

2. The Mozart Elementary School in JP has a Spanish language immersion program and is known for its strong arts integration.

3. The Mission Hill K-8 School in Roxbury offers Spanish language classes and has a progressive education model.

Would you like to know more about any of these schools? I can provide details about:
- Class sizes
- Test scores
