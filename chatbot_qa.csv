Is every child guaranteed a seat in BPS Kindergarten?,"All children are guaranteed a seat in K2, the full-day kindergarten offered in all BPS elementary schools. However, this does not guarantee placement at a specific school on your list. For K0 and K1, seats are limited and not guaranteed due to space constraints, especially for K0, which is offered at fewer schools and often prioritized for students with disabilities.","Yes, every child in BPS Kindergarten is guaranteed a seat, regardless of their home address or school assignment."
Can my child apply for Grade 1 if they completed Kindergarten elsewhere but aren't yet six years old?,"No. BPS does not offer exceptions to the minimum age requirement. Children must turn six by September 1, 2025, to be eligible for Grade 1. If your child turns five by that date, they are eligible for K2.","Hi there! Your child can apply for Grade 1 if they are currently enrolled in a BPS elementary school and completed Kindergarten elsewhere but are not yet six years old. This is because BPS uses a Home-Based Assignment Plan, where your child's home address is used to determine their school assignment. Please feel free to reach out to the BPS Welcome Center with any questions or concerns about your child's eligibility. You can call them at 617-635-9010 or visit their website at https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/."
"How are BPS school assignments made? Is it first-come, first-served?","No, BPS does not assign schools on a first-come, first-served basis. Assignments are made after each registration period closes, using an algorithm that considers your ranked choices, your child's priorities (e.g., sibling priority), and a random number.","Hi there! BPS school assignments are made based on the school assignment rules (see the ""School Assignment Rules (in detail)"" section above). The first-come, first-served policy does not apply to BPS school assignments, as each family receives a customized list of eligible schools. BPS uses a Home-Based Assignment Plan that is based on a student's home address. Families can also choose any citywide school and, in some cases, have regional options. School assignments are made by BPS using a customized algorithm. The algorithm is used for all BPS school assignments, including those for elementary, middle, and high schools. The algorithm ensures that every student is offered a seat and programmatic variety. The algorithm is based on BPS's School Quality Framework (SQF). In addition, BPS also uses a **lottery** to determine the order in which schools are assigned to each student. The lottery ensures that every student has a fair chance of receiving a seat and programmatic variety. The lottery is conducted based on each family's top choices and any remaining seats that remain unassigned."
What is the Home-Based Assignment Plan?,"This plan assigns schools based on your home address. You'll receive a personalized list of 10–14 schools, including those within 1 mile, and other high-quality or option schools.","The Home-Based Assignment Plan is a BPS policy that assigns students to schools based on their home address. It is designed to ensure that every student has access to a diverse range of high-quality schools and programs, regardless of their geographic location. The Home-Based Assignment Plan is based on the Boston Home-Based Education Assessment (BHEAA) criteria, which is used to identify and prioritize schools that provide a high-quality education for students. The plan ensures that students have access to schools that offer programs and opportunities that meet their individual needs and interests. The Home-Based Assignment Plan is an essential aspect of the BPS's approach to providing equitable access to quality education for all students."
What are Option Schools and Citywide Schools?,"Option Schools are added to your personalized list to ensure program variety and available seats. Citywide schools accept applications from all Boston residents, regardless of home address.","Sure! Option Schools are schools that offer additional programs, classes, and extracurricular activities beyond the core curriculum. They are often free to attend and offer a variety of options for students. Citywide Schools, on the other hand, are schools that serve a larger area or population than a single neighborhood. They may offer more advanced courses or programs and are often more expensive to attend. The BPS website has information on all of these options, including details on application requirements, enrollment, and assignments. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
Can I apply to a school not on my list?,"Yes, you can apply to any citywide school. Some families may also have regional options, depending on location and program availability.","Yes, you can apply to any school that is not on your list. However, if you’re interested in a specific school, you may want to check with the school to see if they have any openings. Applying to a school outside of your list will not affect your eligibility or admission process. However, it may make it harder for the school to accommodate your child's needs. I hope that helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask."
When should I register for the 2025–2026 school year?,"Priority Registration (for K0, K1, K2, 6, 7, 9): January 6 – February 7, 2025. All other grades: February 10 – April 4, 2025.","Dear [Name],

How many schools should I list on my application?,Families are encouraged to rank all schools on their choice list in true order of preference. This improves your chances of being matched to a preferred option.,"The number of schools you should list on your application depends on the grade level you are applying to.

  - K0 (Kindergarten)
  - K1 (Grade 1)
  - K2 (Grade 2)
  - 6 (Grade 6)
  - 7 (Grade 7)
  - 8 (Grade 8)

- For elementary school eligibility, you should list at least one school in each of the following grades:
  - K0 (Kindergarten)
  - K1 (Grade 1)
  - K2 (Grade 2)

Because BPS has more than 100 elementary schools, you can list up to 20 schools in each grade. However, you should prioritize selecting schools that are within the 1-mile radius of your home. If you have a school choice form, you should list at least one"
My child is entering Grade 7 from a K–6 school. What do I need to do?,You must submit a school choice form to select a new school for Grade 7. BPS will send these forms in January.,"Hi there! I'm sorry for the delay in responding. In general, if your child is entering Grade 7 from a K–6 school, they will need to fill out the same registration form as any other new student entering grade 7. They will need to meet the age cutoffs for each grade by September 1, 2025, and submit proof of age, immunizations, physical exam, parent ID, and two separate proofs of Boston residency (UTILIZATION BILL, LEASE, BANK STATEMENT). Based on the passage above, How does the age cutoff for each grade differ for new students entering Grade 7?"
Can I update my school choices after receiving an assignment?,"Yes. You may visit a Welcome Center to make new school selections, even if your child was assigned to a school you ranked. Seat availability is not guaranteed.","Yes, you can update your school choices anytime after receiving an assignment.

1. Eligibility based on school assignment rules (see below)

2. Most middle schools serve grades 6-8.

3. Some schools offer early education options starting at K0 or K1.

All BPS high schools serve grades 7-12 and are citywide, meaning every student living in Boston is eligible to apply to all of them."
What happens if my child doesn't get assigned to any of our selected schools?,"For K2, you may receive an administrative assignment if you opt in. For grades 1 and above, BPS will assign your child to the nearest school with an available seat.","Hi there, I'm not able to access your student's school records. However, according to the information provided in the text, families can still choose any citywide school and, in some cases, have regional options. If a student does not receive a seat, the school will typically offer them a spot at a nearby high-quality school or a school of their choice. If a student is assigned to a school of their choice, they will typically receive a seat at that school. However, if a student is assigned to a school that is not in their preferred school, they may have to attend a different school or switch to a different grade level at a different school. I hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
